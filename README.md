## How to be a backend master

###You will need the following things before we begin

* NodeJS (6.*)

  * Linux:
    Use your package manager. Package name is most likely nodejs. 
    E.g. for Ubuntu “sudo apt-get install nodejs”

  * Mac:
    If you don’t have [brew](http://brew.sh/index.html) installed yet, do so.
    Then just run “brew install nodejs” in your terminal.

  * Windows: Pick the appropriate Windows installer  from the [node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    (During install make sure you select the npm package manager as a feature you would like to install)

  * Make sure the NPM was installed with node.
    Run “npm -v” in either your terminal or cmd. It should tell you what version of npm you currently are running.
    * If not…
      * Linux:
        Use your package manger to install package “npm”

     * Mac:
      If you haven’t installed brew yet, now would be a great time to do so.
      Run “brew install npm” in your terminal to get the most glorious of package mangers.

      * Windows:
        Reinstall nodejs, and make sure you select npm package manager. Like the picture shows you how to do.

* Install MongoDB
  * Linux:
    Use that package manager once more. The package name should be “mongodb”

  * Mac:
  “brew install mongodb”

  * Windows:
  Get mongo from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community). Then run the installer.

* Postman:
