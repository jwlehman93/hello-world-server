#Node Installfest

1. Install NodeJS (6.*)

  * Linux: Use your package manager. Package name is most likely nodejs. E.g. for Ubuntu “sudo apt-get install nodejs”

  * Mac: If you don’t have [brew](http://brew.sh/index.html) installed yet, do so. Then just run “brew install nodejs” in your terminal.

  * Windows: Pick the appropriate Windows installer from the [node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). (During install make sure you select the npm package manager as a feature you would like to install). Make sure you select to install the npm as well.
  

2. Make sure the NPM was installed with node
  * Run “npm -v” in either your terminal or cmd. It should tell you what version of npm you currently are running.
  * If not…
    * Linux: Use your package manger to install package “npm”

    * Mac: If you haven’t installed brew yet, now would be a great time to do so. Run “brew install npm” in your terminal to get the most glorious of package mangers.

    * Windows: Reinstall nodejs, and make sure you select npm package manager.

3. Install MongoDB
  * Linux: Use that package manager once more. The package name should be “mongodb”

  * Mac: “brew install mongodb”

  * Windows: Get [mongo from here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community). Then run the installer.

4. Download Postman
  * Get it [here](https://www.getpostman.com/)
